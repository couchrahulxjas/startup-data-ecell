# Startup Success Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project leverages **machine learning** to predict the success of startup companies based on various features such as funding, location, industry, and team size. The main goal is to assist **investors** and **entrepreneurs** in making informed decisions about which startups to invest in or launch, by predicting whether a startup is likely to succeed.

## Dataset
[Startup Success Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishkc06/startup-success-prediction) It contains information on several thousand startup companies, including:

- Funding history  
- Location  
- Industry  
- Team size  
- Other relevant features  

The dataset requires **cleaning and preprocessing**, which involves:

- Removing missing values and outliers  
- Converting categorical variables into numeric format  

## Machine Learning Models
To predict startup success, the following machine learning models were evaluated:

- **XGBoost Classifier (XBC)**  
- **AdaBoost Classifier (ABC)**  
- **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)**  
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)**
